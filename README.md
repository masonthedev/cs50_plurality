# cs50_plurality

This is my solution for plurality in week3.

In this assignment we dive into creating custom data structures and I was tasked with finishing provided code. 

My assignment was to implement a function that iterated over each of the provided candidates, to check if their names matched the given name, if yes, increment candidate vote count or return false. 

Then i had to print the winner of the election by finding the maximum number of votes and announcing the winner.
